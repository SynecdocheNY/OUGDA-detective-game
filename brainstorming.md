vehicles in this setting being semi intelligent? like basic logic "machines" that the player can interact with
---




Different vehicles have different personalities, maybe slightly different designs too to keep them easy to tell apart (but not too different so they'll be easier to model)



Could serve as comic relief



could serve as logic puzzles i.e. a certain vehicle won't do what you want unless [condition] is met and you have to figure out how to get that condition or trick it into thinking condition is met (has orders not to cooperate with "cops," have to figure out how to get around that)



Fast travel, but with a bit more personality than your typical click-button-go-here travel system 



Borrowing this sentient transport idea from the Murderbot book series

Design wise, I'm imagining a sleak, art deco train engine like shape with the pilot's seat nestled on top, and also a big polluting steam engine inelegantly wedged into the middle or back
---






Pilot could be a clockwork ai kind of thing



Or it could be piloted by a small creature, I'm thinking insect or crustacean. (You're telling me a shrimp drove this bus?) (Mmm steamed clams)



Or could be biomechanical, this could work for a darker setting, maybe body horror. Gives our steampunk setting something unique. Imagining like a giant eye jutting out of the machine. Or maybe a humanoid torso, can incorporate art deco angel design



Of course we could do all three with each representing different tech levels, like ai vehicles are last generation tech that you still see sometimes, shrimp are the modern vehicle, and biomechanical are the hot new tech. 

Ai < shrimp < biomechanical horrors, very intuitive.
